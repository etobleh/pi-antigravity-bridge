# Development & Debugging

How to build, test, and debug this extension outside pi.

## Build, test, typecheck

```bash
npm install
npm test          # unit tests via vitest (no agy spawn, no network)
npm run build     # tsc --noEmit type check
```

The integration scripts below spawn a real `agy` process and need a logged-in account. The unit tests (`npm test`) need neither.

## Standalone scripts

These exercise the pipeline without pi. Useful for isolating where a bug lives (driver? provider? pi loader?).

```bash
# Drive the provider's streamSimple directly (no pi TUI) and assert the
# full event lifecycle: start -> text_start -> text_delta -> text_end ->
# done. The closest thing to a pi turn without pi.
npx tsx scripts/test-provider.ts

# Load the extension through a mock ExtensionAPI and assert registerProvider
# + registerCommand (/agy) fire with the right shape. No agy spawn.
npx tsx scripts/test-extension.ts

# Load the extension through pi's REAL loader and confirm the antigravity/*
# models register. This is the in-pi smoke test.
npm run smoke:pi

# Live smoke for the stream-json engine. OPT-IN: spends a little Antigravity
# quota. Proves the persistent process: init binds a conversation, text deltas
# arrive, the result settles, and a second turn reuses the process.
AGY_LIVE=1 node --experimental-strip-types scripts/smoke-stream-json.mjs
```

## Debugging a hang or "stuck" turn

Most "stuck" reports trace to one of:

1. **agy blocked on a permission prompt.** The provider passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` by default because no interactive input can answer an agy-native prompt. The managed provider agent has no native tools, but this still matters to plain `AskAntigravity` runs. If you turned permissions off, restore them with `/agy permissions on`. See the README Permissions section.
2. **agy never started.** Check `AGY_BIN` is on PATH (or set explicitly). The spawner swallows spawn ENOENT into the result's stderr, surfaced by the provider as an error event.
3. **Conversation id never bound.** On `stream-json` the `init` event carries the id, so a missing binding means the turn never produced a result event. `/agy doctor` prints the last lifecycle events.
4. **Print-mode environmental hang.** `pi -p` can hang with zero output in some containers (upstream [google-antigravity/antigravity-cli#318](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/issues/318)). It affects built-in providers too, not this extension. Validate the turn with `scripts/test-provider.ts` instead.

## Regression tests worth knowing

- `tests/agent-config.test.ts` / `tests/driver-args.test.ts` - bundled `pi` agent installation and fixed `--agent pi` spawn arguments.
- `tests/bridge-tools.test.ts` - bridge mode selection, including pi builtins and recursion filtering.
- `tests/stream-roundtrip.test.ts` - the stream-json parser, wrapper replay, and no-patch toolUse round-trip store.
- `tests/provider-streaming.test.ts` - drives streamSimple with an injected fake driver (no agy) and asserts how pi's reasoning level maps onto the agy `--effort` tier (forward, clamp, omit).
- `tests/provider-digest.test.ts` - the G1 context digest builder: injects pi-side context without replaying agy's own history.
- `tests/patch-cleanup.test.ts` - legacy-patch detection and restore, real fs via tmpdirs, no mocks.
- `tests/mcp-server.test.ts` - the MCP tool bridge end-to-end against a real (port 0) server: capability gate, per-pid config lifecycle, shared-secret token gate, 1 MB body cap, protocol-version clamp. The provider owns the tool catalog and the round-trip; the server only ferries list/call.
