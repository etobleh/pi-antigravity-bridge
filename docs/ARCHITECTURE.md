# Architecture

How the provider works internally. For build/test/debug workflow see [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Turn engine

The provider runs one turn engine: a long-lived `agy --agent pi --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json` process per provider. The extension installs its bundled minimal agent at `~/.gemini/config/agents/pi.md`; that agent has no native tools, while coding tools come from pi through MCP. Turns are fed over stdin; agy emits NDJSON events on stdout; the driver parses them and streams text into pi token by token. Conversation binding comes from the `init` event, tool steps arrive as typed events (no protobuf decoding), and token usage is live.

Shared infrastructure: session binding (`sessions.json`), runtime config, the `AskAntigravity` tool, the MCP tool bridge surface, and the G1 context digest (off by default - see below).

## Module map

```
extensions/index.ts   pi extension entry: provider registration, model discovery, /agy command, lifecycle notices
src/provider.ts       streamSimple: pi Context -> agy turn -> pi event stream; owns the G9 round-trip store and the G1 digest
src/driver.ts         stream-json driver: persistent agy process, turn serialization, conversation binding, idle/abort timers
src/agent-config.ts   atomically installs the bundled minimal `pi` agy agent before spawn
src/bridge-tools.ts   selects builtins/extension tools for the configured MCP bridge surface
src/stream-events.ts  agy NDJSON event parser (init / step_update / result) + usage mapping onto pi's Usage
src/skills.ts         activate_skill bridge: exposes the pi Agent Skills catalog to agy, answered by the bridge directly
src/patch-cleanup.ts  detects a leftover invokeTool patch from pre-1.3.0 installs; /agy patch-cleanup restores the backup
src/discovery.ts      conversation-id binding for the AskAntigravity one-shot tool (agy -p never prints its conversation id)
src/models.ts         agy models -> pi Model projection (full catalog, per-model effort)
src/sessions.ts       atomic JSON store: pi session -> agy conversation + watermark
src/config.ts         persisted runtime config (bridgeTools, digest, mode, permissions, model/thinking defaults)
src/ask-tool.ts       the AskAntigravity one-shot delegation tool (model/thinking defaults)
src/mcp-server.ts     MCP tool bridge server: ferries tools/list + tools/call; calls park in the provider round-trip
src/diff-render.ts    compatibility rendering for agy-native edits as git diffs
```

No generated protobuf code, no SQLite dependency.

## Stream-json engine

### Process and events

The driver spawns `agy --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json` once per provider and keeps it alive across turns (`/agy doctor` shows the reuse counter). A turn writes the prompt to stdin and reads NDJSON events until the terminal `result`:

| event | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `init` | conversation binding (`conversation_id`); the driver remembers it and resumes later turns via `--conversation <id>` |
| `step_update` | `user_input` / `checkpoint` / `agent_response` / `tool` steps; agent text arrives as `text_delta` on live agy (1.1.13+), with `usage` attached |
| `result` | terminal; live builds report status `SUCCESS` (older builds `OK` - both accepted) |

Unknown event kinds parse as `{kind:"unknown"}` so a future agy release degrades instead of crashing the reader loop. Shapes were captured from live output and cross-checked against tianzuo/pi-antigravity `lib/events.ts` (MIT).

Usage maps onto pi's `Usage` (input/output/thinking/cache-read tokens); cost stays zero because agy runs on subscription quota.

### No-patch tool round-trip (G9)

The MCP bridge server executes no tools itself. A `tools/call` parks in the provider's round-trip store; the provider ends the current pi assistant message with a `toolUse` stop reason for the real pi tool; pi executes it in its own loop (native cards, permissions, hooks); the `toolResult` completes the parked MCP response on the next stream call. No pi patch, no privileged API.

The bridge advertises active registered pi builtins in both `mcp` and `all` modes. It filters disabled tools from `tools/list` and rejects stale calls after a tool is disabled. Calls execute as real pi tools, so their cards use pi's renderers. The managed agent has no agy-native tools. The skills bridge exposes one `activate_skill` tool whose enum is the pi Agent Skills catalog; the bridge answers it directly, no round-trip.

### Context digest (G1)

By default the prompt agy receives is only the latest user message: agy keeps its own history. When `config.digest` is on (`AGY_DIGEST`, `/agy digest on`), the provider prepends a DELTA digest of pi-side context agy was not spawned for - compaction summaries, other-provider turns, pi-tool results. Off by default because the digest changes every turn and defeats agy's server-side prompt cache (~25-30k tokens re-billed per turn). Enable it for mixed-provider sessions where agy must see pi-side context; pure antigravity sessions gain nothing, and bridge round-trips deliver tool results through the bridge, not the digest.

### Removed: the legacy-sqlite engine (1.3.2)

The pre-1.3.0 engine (spawn `agy -p`, poll the SQLite conversation DB, decode protobuf step payloads) was removed in 1.3.2. agy 1.1.18 changed the step-row storage to a two-phase write (a metadata-only placeholder row that grows in place), which the polling decoder read once as an empty placeholder and never re-read: turns completed with the full reply in the database and zero text streamed to pi (issue #1, reported by @imatimba). The engine reverse-engineered an undocumented storage format, so every agy storage change risked repeating that silent failure. The stream-json engine shares none of that code path and is unaffected by storage-format changes. `AGY_ENGINE` and the `engine` config key are gone; a stale value in an existing `config.json` is ignored.
