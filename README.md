# pi-antigravity-bridge

A Gemini model provider **and** the `AskAntigravity` delegation tool for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent), both built on Google's `agy` CLI. It registers `antigravity/gemini-*` models in pi's `/model` picker (streaming), and provides the `AskAntigravity` tool for one-shot delegation - the same combined shape as `pi-claude-bridge`.

If you also have [`@estebanforge/pi-ask-antigravity`](https://github.com/EstebanForge/pi-ask-antigravity) installed, this bridge takes over: pi-ask-antigravity detects the bridge and registers nothing, so the `AskAntigravity` tool is never duplicated.

## What it does

You pick a Gemini model in pi's `/model` picker. pi routes each turn through this provider. A single persistent `agy` process runs in your workspace; pi feeds it each turn, parses its stream-json events, and streams the agent text back into pi token by token. Token usage is live.

Multi-turn works. The provider binds a pi session to an agy conversation id (persisted under `~/.pi/agent/antigravity-bridge/sessions.json`) and resumes it on the next turn via `--conversation <id>`. agy keeps its own history, so only the latest user message is sent each turn.

## What it cannot do

Provider-owned agy runs with `--agent pi`, an extension-managed custom agent with no native tools. Coding operations use pi's builtin tools through the MCP bridge, so reads, edits, and commands execute in pi's normal tool loop with native cards, hooks, and diff rendering. The extension installs the agent definition at `~/.gemini/config/agents/pi.md` before it starts the provider process.

Residual limits:

- Turning the MCP bridge off leaves provider agy with no tools.
- pi tools run without per-action approval, as they do for every other model in pi. See [Permissions](#permissions) below.
- No cost accounting: cost stays zero because agy runs on your subscription quota. Token usage is live.

## MCP tool bridge (agy uses pi's tools)

While agy is the active model it normally cannot see pi's universe of extensions: agentmemory, codegraph, web search, slack/asana, the `Ask*` delegations, and any other installed pi tool. This extension optionally bridges that gap.

The bridge starts a localhost MCP server inside pi's process. `tools/list` returns the configured pi tool surface, including registered builtin file/shell tools; only `AskAntigravity` is always filtered out. A `tools/call` routes into pi's own tool loop via the round-trip described below. agy discovers the server through a per-invocation config: the bridge writes `.agents/mcp_config.json` into a bridge-controlled dir (`~/.pi/agent/antigravity-bridge/agy-mcp-<pid>/`) and the provider passes that dir as an extra `--add-dir` when it spawns agy. The user's global MCP config (`~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`) is never touched, so standalone agy outside pi does not connect to the bridge.

**No patch required.** Bridge calls park in the provider's round-trip store; the provider ends the pi assistant message with a `toolUse` stop reason for the real pi tool, pi executes it in its own loop (native cards, permissions, hooks), and the toolResult completes the parked MCP response on the next stream call. This is the same mechanism tianzuo/pi-antigravity uses; upstream pi APIs only.

**Recursion safety.** Only the provider's agy receives the extra bridge `--add-dir` and selects `--agent pi`. The `AskAntigravity` tool spawns its own plain agy with just the workspace, so it has no pi tools and cannot re-enter. `AskAntigravity` is also filtered from the exposed tool list. Standalone agy can see the installed `pi` agent but does not select it unless explicitly launched with `--agent pi`.

**Cost / fan-out.** In `all` mode every registered pi tool except `AskAntigravity` is exposed, including builtins and other delegation tools like `AskClaude`/`AskCodex`. agy can therefore chain into other models via the bridge, which is a cost/time fan-out vector.

**Security.** The MCP server binds to `127.0.0.1` only and requires a per-session shared-secret header (`x-bridge-token`) that agy sends from the bridge config; browsers cannot set custom headers on a simple cross-origin POST, so this blocks web CSRF against the loopback server. Request bodies are size-capped. This is intended for single-user developer machines: any local process running as the same user can read the token from the per-pid config and call the exposed tools, so do not run it on a shared host where you do not trust other same-user processes.

### Native cards and skills

MCP calls to pi builtins execute as real pi tools, so their cards use pi's own renderers. The managed `pi` agent has no native tools; coding operations always enter through MCP.

When the bridge is on, agy also gets one `activate_skill` tool whose enum is
your pi Agent Skills catalog; calling it returns the SKILL.md body. The bridge
answers it directly, no pi round-trip. `/agy doctor` prints driver counters,
bridge port, and the last lifecycle events without spending tokens.

## Install

> **No patch required.** The bridge runs on pi's public APIs only; the extension never edits your pi install. If an older version of this extension patched your pi (adding `pi.invokeTool()`), the leftover is inert and a pi update removes it. The extension detects it once and offers `/agy patch-cleanup` to restore the original files from the backup immediately.

Install with pi's package manager:

```bash
pi install npm:@estebanforge/pi-antigravity-bridge
```

Requires the **`agy` CLI** installed and authenticated. If you don't have it, follow Google's [official install guide](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/install) for your platform, then run `agy` once to complete Google OAuth. The extension resolves `agy` on `$PATH`, or via the `AGY_BIN` environment variable.

## Usage

Pick a model and talk to pi as usual:

```
/model
```

Look for the models namespaced as: antigravity

Or specify a model directly:

```
/model antigravity/gemini-3-6-flash-medium
```

Model ids are slugified from the `agy models` output (`Gemini 3.6 Flash (Medium)` becomes `gemini-3-6-flash-medium`). Discovery runs once at extension load. Run `/reload` after an `agy update` to refresh the list.

If `agy models` fails at load (binary missing, auth not done, network stall), a fallback catalog still populates the picker so you get a clear runtime error instead of an empty list.

### Bridge surface

`config.json` selects the bridge surface:

| Key | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bridgeTools` | `none` (bridge off), `mcp` (pi builtins + pi-mcp-adapter tools), `all` (every registered tool, incl. builtins and other `Ask*` delegations; always excludes `AskAntigravity`) | `mcp` |
| `digest` | `off` (stable prompts; agy's prompt cache hits) or `on` (inject a delta of pi-side context - compaction summaries, other-provider turns - into each agy prompt; the delta changes every turn, so agy re-bills the full context). Enable for mixed-provider sessions where agy must see pi-side context | `off` |
| `systemPrompt` | `on` (prepend pi's system prompt - operating instructions plus the global agent-dir `AGENTS.md` and ancestor `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` - to the first prompt of each new agy conversation) or `off` (agy-native behavior) | `on` |

Env overrides: `AGY_BRIDGE_TOOLS`, `AGY_DIGEST`, `AGY_SYSTEM_PROMPT`. Env wins over the file, so while `AGY_DIGEST` or `AGY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is set, the matching `/agy digest` or `/agy system-prompt` toggle persists a value that never takes effect.

### The /agy command

`/agy` configures the provider at runtime. Settings persist to `~/.pi/agent/antigravity-bridge/config.json` and take effect on the next turn.

```
/agy                      status, or open the mode/permissions/model/thinking picker (TUI)
/agy status               print current mode, permissions, model + session counts
/agy doctor               bridge state, driver counters, bridge port, last lifecycle events
/agy mode plan            review-only agy execution mode
/agy mode accept-edits    allow agy execution (default; provider coding still uses pi tools)
/agy permissions on|off   auto-approve / prompt for tool calls (see warning)
/agy model flash|pro|gemini   default model alias for the AskAntigravity tool
/agy thinking low|medium|high default thinking tier for the AskAntigravity tool
/agy digest on|off        inject pi-side context into agy prompts (default off; see table above)
/agy system-prompt on|off send pi's system prompt + AGENTS.md to new agy conversations (default on)
/agy patch-cleanup        restore the original pi files if an older version patched them
/agy clear                drop all session bindings (force fresh conversations)
```

### Permissions

pi itself has no built-in approval gate. Unlike codex, claude, or agy running interactively, pi does not prompt you to confirm each tool action before it runs. That is the host environment this extension lives in.

The provider remains non-interactive and passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` by default so an agy-native permission prompt cannot hang the stream. The managed `pi` agent does not expose agy's command or edit tools; commands and edits go through pi builtins, which have pi's normal no-confirmation behavior.

If you want no pi tool execution, set `bridgeTools` to `none`. `/agy mode plan` still controls agy's execution mode. Do not combine `--sandbox` with skip-permissions ([#36](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/issues/36)).

### Run pi inside a sandbox

For isolation when running any agent that executes commands without a confirmation gate, run pi inside [**construct-cli**](https://github.com/EstebanForge/construct-cli) - EstebanForge's sandbox for AI agents. Isolated container, no path escape, ephemeral filesystem, `strict` / `offline` network modes, secret redaction. The blast radius of a bad command stays in the container, not your host. Install and usage instructions are in that repo.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AGY_BIN` | Path to the agy binary. Defaults to `agy` on PATH. |
| `AGY_EXTRA_ARGS` | Extra args appended to every invocation. Whitespace-split. |
| `AGY_CONVERSATIONS_DIR` | Override the conversations DB directory. |
| `AGY_MODE` | Override execution mode: `plan` (review-only) or `accept-edits` (default). Wins over the config file. |
| `AGY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS` | `1`/`true` (default) to pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for agy-native tools. `0`/`false` permits interactive prompts, which cannot be answered non-interactively. Wins over the config file. |
| `AGY_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Default model alias for the `AskAntigravity` tool (`flash`/`pro`/`gemini`, or a tier/version qualifier). Wins over the config file. |
| `AGY_DEFAULT_THINKING` | Default thinking tier for the `AskAntigravity` tool: `low`/`medium`/`high`. Anything else falls back to `medium`. Wins over the config file. |

## Terms of Service notice

Google's [Antigravity ToS](https://antigravity.google/terms) (Section 6) prohibits accessing the service "in connection with products not provided by us", and names as its example using tools like Hermes/OpenClaw with Antigravity OAuth. That targets reusing your credentials in a non-Google harness that calls Google's backend directly.

This extension does not do that. It spawns the official, unmodified `agy` binary as a subprocess; `agy` performs its own OAuth and makes its own calls to Google. This code never sees, extracts, or reuses your token, and never contacts Antigravity's backend. It only reads what `agy` itself produces locally: its stream-json output. From Google's server-side view there is no signal that distinguishes "agy launched by pi" from "agy launched by a terminal, an IDE task runner, or cron": same signed binary, same authenticated calls.

Google's reported enforcement to date (the February 2026 suspensions) targeted token-reuse tools, not spawning the official CLI.

pi-antigravity-bridge practical risk is low, near zero. But not zero: the "in connection with" wording is broad, and Google can suspend accounts at its discretion regardless of whether a breach is provable. Grey area. Safe for now. You should read "news" about this online from time to time.

This is engineering analysis, not legal advice. Use against your own Antigravity account at your own risk; I am not responsible for any consequence to your account.
